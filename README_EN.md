## 🎯 What is a One Person Company?

> **One Person Company (OPC)** = Personal-driven + Sustainable Income + Smart Leverage + Lifestyle-first

A one person company is a business model with the following characteristics:

| Characteristic             | Description                                           | Anti-patterns                     |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 👤**Solo Operation**   | Built and maintained by 1 person (or small team ≤5)  | ❌ Projects requiring large teams |
| 💵**Sustainable Income** | Stable cash flow (MRR/ARR)                           | ❌ Pure open source/hobby projects|
| 🤖**Leverage Effect**   | Relies on software/content/automation, not labor     | ❌ Consulting/labor-intensive     |
| 🎨**Autonomous Control** | Pursues freedom and autonomy, not blind expansion    | ❌ VC-driven high-growth companies|

**💡 Core Philosophy:** Build a life, not just a company.

---

## 🚀 Why This List?

There are many entrepreneurship resources available, but **high-quality Chinese content is scarce** in the **one person company** niche:

- ❌ Most entrepreneurship content focuses on VC/funding routes
- ❌ Technical tutorials are disconnected from business practice
- ❌ Success stories are mostly foreign, lacking China-specific cases
- ✅ **This list focuses on**: Replicable small & beautiful business models + Real financial data + East-West integration

**Learning Resources**

- [Failory](https://www.failory.com/) - 90% of startups fail, learn how to avoid failure. Weekly shares startup failure cases and success stories.

## 💡 Startup Idea Pool

> 🎲 Discover real user pain points and find worthwhile startup opportunities

**Recommended Tools**

- [IdeaLens](https://muselearner.com/) - Discover real user pain points, understand what users really need before building. IdeaLens listens to real discussions, extracts pain points, tags user personas and scenarios, and prioritizes by urgency, helping you build what users truly need.
  ![IdeaLens](assets/images/idealens.png)

Use **The Mom Test** principles:

```
1. Define target user (as specific as possible)
   ❌ "Want to help entrepreneurs"  
   ✅ "Help Bilibili up主 analyze video data"

2. Discover real pain points (avoid fake needs)
   ❌ "Do you think this feature is useful?"  
   ✅ "What difficulties did you encounter when analyzing data last time?"

3. Validate willingness to pay (collect money early)
   ❌ "If I build this, would you use it?"  
   ✅ "If it existed now, how much would you pay?"

4. Fast MVP test (1-2 weeks)
   - Create landing page + Waitlist
   - Manual service delivery (fake automation)
   - At least 5 interested paying users → Start development
```
